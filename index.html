    <p>This is a very basic website designed to play with the css
        style sheet functionality as well as inserting dynamic objects
        using a link to an external javascript file.</p> 
    <p> lets see how this goes</p>
    <p> Below is a list of colors that should be displayed as the
        color of their namesake. 
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li class="red">Red</li> 
       <li class="blue">Blue</li>
       <li class="green">Green</li>
       <li class="purple">Purple</li>
       <li class="pink">Pink</li>
       <li class="white">White</li>
    </ul>
    <p> The below list is the same, but not colored because I colored them
        based on class, not by flag:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Red</li> 
        <li>Blue</li>
        <li>Green</li>
        <li>Purple</li>
        <li>Pink</li>
     </ul>
    <p>Under here I'm going to put the link to an online image, it 
        is a cute lil California Sheepshead.
